# Design notes

Kernel Module Management brings a new `Module` CRD.

`Module` represents an out-of-tree kernel module that must be inserted into the cluster nodes’ kernel through a `ModuleLoader` scheduled by a `DaemonSet`.

KMM optionally builds and runs DriverContainers on the cluster.

It picks the right `ModuleLoader` image by leveraging kernel mappings in the `Module` CRD that describe which image should be used for which kernel.

A kernel mapping maps either a literal kernel name or a regex with a kernel’s node.

This allows for more flexibility when targeting a set of kernels (e.g. “for Ubuntu nodes, build from that repository”).

Variables available at build time still reflect the actual kernel version.

## `Module` CRD

```yaml
apiVersion: ooto.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Module
metadata:
  name: module-sample
spec:
  additionalVolumes:
    # All volumes here are available into the DriverContainer / DevicePlugin pod.
    # Users should mount those by adding corresponding volumeMounts under .spec.devicePlugin
    # and .spec.moduleLoader.
    - name: some-volume
      configMap:
        name: some-configmap
  devicePlugin: # is a Container spec
    # This container will be privileged and will mount
    # /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins automatically.
    name: overwritten-anyway
    image: some-image
  moduleLoader: # is a Container spec
    # This container will not be privileged by default.
    # It will mount /lib/modules and /usr/lib/modules automatically.
    name: overwritten-anyway
    image: overwritten-anyway
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: [SYS_MODULE] # this is enough in most cases
  kernelMappings:
    - literal: 5.16.11-200.fc35.x86_64
      containerImage: quay.io/vendor/module-sample:fedora-5.16.11-200.fc35.x86_64
    - literal: 5.4.0-1054-gke
      containerImage: quay.io/vendor/module-sample:ubuntu-5.4.0-1054-gke
    - regexp: '^.*\-gke$'
      build:
        buildArgs:
          - name: SOME_KEY
            value: SOME_VALUE
        pull:
          insecure: false
        push:
          insecure: false
        dockerfile: |
          FROM some-image
          RUN some-command
      containerImage: quay.io/vendor/module-sample:gke
  selector: # top-level selector
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.VMX: true

  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2022-03-07T14:01:00Z"
      status: False
      type: Progressing

      status: True
      type: Ready
```

## In-cluster builds

Virtually any Kubernetes distribution ships with its own kernel.
It is thus challenging for a kernel module vendor to make DriverContainer images available for all kernels available
in all Kubernetes distributions out there (or even for a subset of them).

KMM supports in-cluster builds of DriverContainer images when those are not made available by the vendor. The in-cluster build system is able to build an image from any Git repository that contains a `Dockerfile`. It can then push said image to a user-provided repository, optionally using authentication provided in a Kubernetes secret.

**Optional:** on upstream Kubernetes, we may want to deploy an in-cluster registry to host in-cluster built images.

**On OCP**, the build mechanism would be BuildConfig (maybe Shipwright in the future) and we can leverage the
integrated in-cluster registry.

## Unloading modules

Users must provide a [preStop lifecycle hook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/) to their DriverContainer pod template to make sure that their module is unloaded when the DriverContainer pod exits.

## Security

### DriverContainer privileges

By default, the operator would only grant the [`CAP_SYS_MODULE`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
capability to DriverContainer `DaemonSets`.

### Kubernetes API privileges

The KMM Operator would only be granted a limited set of Kubernetes API privileges:

- Read, modify (for kernel version labeling) and watch `Nodes`;
- Read and watch `Modules`, update their status;
- Read, create, modify and watch `DaemonSets`;
- Read, create, modify and watch `Build` objects (from whatever system we agree on);
- Read `Secrets` for pull and build secrets.
