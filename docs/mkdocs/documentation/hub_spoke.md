# Hub & Spoke

In Hub & Spoke scenarios, many Spoke clusters are connected to a central, powerful Hub cluster.
[Open Cluster Management (OCM)](https://open-cluster-management.io) is the reference open-source implementation of this
pattern, and KMM depends on it to operate in those scenarios.

## On the Hub

The KMM project ships KMM-Hub, an edition of KMM dedicated to Hub clusters.
KMM-Hub is aware of all kernel versions running on the Spokes and determines which node on which cluster should receive
a kernel module.  
It runs all compute-intensive tasks such as image builds and kmod signing, and prepares trimmed-down `Module` to be
transferred to the Spokes via OCM.  
KMM-Hub cannot be used to load kernel modules on the Hub cluster.
To do that, [install the regular edition of KMM](./install.md).

### Installing KMM-Hub

#### With [OLM](https://olm.operatorframework.io/) (recommended)

Follow the instructions on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/kernel-module-management-hub).

#### With `kubectl`

First, [install the cert-manager dependency](./install.md#installing-the-cert-manager-dependency).

Then, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kernel-module-management/config/default-hub
```

### The `ManagedClusterModule` CRD

The `ManagedClusterModule` CRD is used to configure the deployment of kernel modules on Spoke clusters.
It is cluster-scoped, wraps a `Module` spec and adds a few additional fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: hub.kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedClusterModule
metadata:
  name: my-mcm
  # No namespace, because this resource is cluster-scoped.
spec:
  moduleSpec:
    # Contains moduleLoader and devicePlugin sections, just like in a Module resource.
    selector:
      node-wants-my-mcm: 'true'  # Selects nodes within the ManagedCluster.

  spokeNamespace: some-namespace  # Specifies in which namespace the Module should be created

  selector:
    wants-my-mcm: 'true'  # Selects ManagedCluster objects
```

If build or signing instructions are present under `.spec.moduleSpec`, those pods are run on the Hub cluster in the
operator's namespace.  
When the `.spec.selector` matches one or more `ManagedCluster` resources, then KMM-Hub creates a `ManifestWork` resource
in the corresponding namespace(s).
The `ManifestWork` contains a trimmed-down `Module` resource, with kernel mappings preserved but all `build` and `sign`
subsections removed.
`containerImage` fields that contain image names ending with a tag are replaced with their digest equivalent.

## On the Spokes

After the installation of KMM on the Spoke, no further action is required.
Create `ManagedClusterModule` from the Hub to deploy kernel modules on Spoke clusters.

### Running KMM on the Spoke

KMM can be installed on the Spokes cluster through an OCM `Policy` object.
In addition to installing KMM from the Operator Hub and running it in a lightweight Spoke mode, the `Policy` configures
additional RBAC required for the OCM agent to be able to manage `Module` resources.
